# Find-The-Pots
Uses a photon sensor to detector when a car goes over a pothole and then maps the data to google maps 
The front end application can be found at http://findthepots.appspot.com/
Feel free to choose an option for beginning and destination to take a look at the pre-existing data on potholes that we have in our server!

Main folder can be found in gs_pot_servers/1-hello-world
