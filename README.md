# Find-The-Pots
Uses a photon sensor to detector when a car goes over a pothole and then maps the data to google maps 
The front end application can be found at gs_pot_servers/1-hello-world/index.html <br /> <br />
Feel free to choose an option for beginning and destination to take a look at the pre-existing data on potholes that we have in our server and checkout the optimized google maps routes that use the pothole data to avoid roads with pothole alongside with the route specifications on the side nav aswell!
